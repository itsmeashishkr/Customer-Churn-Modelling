# Customer-Churn-Modelling
 The goal is to create a geodemographic segmentation. The purpose of the project is to understand whether a customer will act a certain (binary response). In marketing, geodemographic segmentation is a multivariate statistical classification technique for discovering whether the individuals of a population fall into different groups by making quantitative comparisons of multiple characteristics with the assumption that the differences within any group should be less than the differences between groups.
